          5 Strategies to Improve Your Pai Gow Poker Skills
        </h1>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Want to boost your <strong>Pai Gow Poker</strong> game and beat the
          dealer more consistently? We’ve got five key tips that will help you
          strategize—whether you’re playing standard or
          <strong> Face-Up Pai Gow</strong>. Best of all, you can test these
          tips in our <strong>free online trainer</strong> before hitting a
          live table.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">
          1. Master Your 2-Card Hand
        </h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          The biggest mistake beginners make is ignoring the impact of the
          two-card low hand. A strong low hand can secure half the battle if it
          beats the dealer’s low. Use our trainer to see how different splits
          affect your 5-card high hand and 2-card low hand together.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">
          2. Understand the Joker
        </h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          In <em>Pai Gow Poker</em>, the Joker acts primarily as an Ace,
          unless it can help complete a flush or straight. Practice leveraging
          it in our trainer to form crucial 5-card combos, or occasionally
          create a crucial pair up front in <strong>Face-Up Pai Gow</strong>.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">
          3. Explore the House Way
        </h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Most casinos use a “house way” to set the dealer’s hands. In
          <strong> Face-Up Pai Gow</strong>, you can see this logic in action.
          By knowing how the house arranges pairs, straights, and flushes, you
          can predict their final layout and adjust yours for maximum edge.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">
          4. Don’t Overlook Side Bets
        </h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          <strong>Fortune bonus</strong>, <em>Insurance</em>, or other side bets
          can offer substantial payouts—even if the main hand pushes or loses.
          However, they come with higher house edges. Use our free <strong><Link href="/" className="text-blue-600 hover:underline">online Pai Gow trainer</Link></strong> to see how often you’d hit a 3-of-a-kind or better for the Fortune bet.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">
          5. Practice, Practice, Practice
        </h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Ultimately, consistent success in Pai Gow Poker (especially
          <strong> Face-Up Pai Gow</strong>) comes from understanding
          probabilities and refining your hand-splitting strategy. Our trainer
          lets you practice for free, track your progress, and learn from each
          round without financial risk.
        </p>
