          Face-Up Pai Gow Poker: Everything You Need to Know
        </h1>

        <p className="mb-4">
          <strong>Face-Up Pai Gow</strong> is a unique variation of Pai Gow
          Poker where the dealer’s cards are fully visible. This adds a new
          dimension to the game, letting you set your hands with full knowledge
          of what you’re up against. On this page, we’ll break down how Face-Up
          differs from standard Pai Gow and how you can <strong>practice</strong> using our free online trainer.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">
          How Does Face-Up Pai Gow Differ?
        </h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          In <strong>standard Pai Gow</strong>, both your seven cards and the
          dealer’s seven cards are hidden. In <em>Face-Up Pai Gow</em>, the
          dealer’s 7-card set is dealt face up. This means you can see exactly
          how the dealer arranges their high and low hands (often following the
          “house way”). This extra info can guide how you set your own two-card
          and five-card hands, creating a more strategic experience.
        </p>
