          The Joker Card in Pai Gow Poker: How It Works & Why It Matters
        </h1>

        <p className="mb-4">
          In <strong>Pai Gow Poker</strong>, the <em>Joker card</em> adds a
          twist. Unlike other wild cards that can substitute for any rank or
          suit, the Pai Gow Joker is considered <strong>semi-wild</strong>. It
          primarily acts as an Ace—unless it can complete a flush or a straight
          in your five-card hand. In this post, we’ll break down exactly how the
          Joker card functions and how you can use it to gain an edge in both
          standard and <strong>Face-Up Pai Gow</strong>.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">
          What Is a Semi-Wild Joker?
        </h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          In many poker variants, a wild card can become any rank or suit. In <strong>Pai Gow Poker</strong>, the Joker is more limited. By default,
          it’s treated as an Ace. However, if you’re just one card away from
          completing a flush or a straight, the Joker can fill that slot,
          effectively turning into the rank and suit you need for that 5-card
          combination.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">
          Key Scenarios Where the Joker Helps
        </h2>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
          <li>
            <strong>Flush Completion:</strong> If you have four clubs in your
            hand, the Joker can become the fifth club, granting you a flush.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Straight Filling:</strong> Missing one rank in a 5-card
            straight? The Joker becomes that missing rank. For instance, if
            you’re holding 9, 10, J, Q, Joker, you effectively have a straight.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Ace High Card:</strong> If the Joker can’t help form
            a straight or flush, it remains an Ace by default—often the highest
            rank in your hand.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">
          Using the Joker in Your 2-Card Hand
        </h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          While the Joker primarily benefits your 5-card high hand, you can also
          place it in your 2-card low hand if it secures a valuable pair. For
          example, if your 7-card distribution has a single 7 plus the Joker, 
          you can form a <strong>Pair of 7s</strong> in your low hand, leaving
          a potentially stronger 5-card hand for the high. This is especially
          useful in <strong>Face-Up Pai Gow</strong> once you see the dealer’s
          arrangement.

          Tips for Joker Optimization
        </h2>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
          <li>
            Always check if the Joker can boost you to a <strong>flush</strong>{" "}
            or <strong>straight</strong>—these combos generally outrank
            standard pairs and two-pair hands.
          </li>
          <li>
            If forming a major combo is impossible, see if placing the Joker in
            your 2-card hand to form a pair helps you beat the dealer’s low
            hand.
          </li>
          <li>
            In <em>Fortune bonus</em> side bets, straights, flushes, or higher
            combos often yield bigger payouts. Factor the Joker’s potential into
            whether you’ll bet on Fortune or other side bets.
          </li>
        </ul>
